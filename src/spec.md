## Summary
**Goal:** Update the additional promise reveal button styling to an aesthetic pink theme and change its label text.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the additional promise reveal button color styling from coral to a pretty/dark pink palette, including hover/focus/active states, while keeping text readable and aligned with the romantic theme.
- Update the button label text to exactly: "because we love each other. Click me."

**User-visible outcome:** The additional promise reveal button appears in an aesthetic pink style (with matching interaction states) and displays the new label text exactly as specified.
