  "summary": "The diff implements the Promise Day single-page UI with the specified three image URLs, top-then-two-below photo layout, and an emoji shower rendered as a non-interactive overlay above the card. It also introduces additional authentication/actor plumbing and extra page elements that were not requested.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Introduces Internet Identity authentication context/provider and actor/React Query identity-based actor creation, despite authentication being a stated non-goal and not required for the single public page.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly lists adding user accounts/Internet Identity authentication as a non-goal; the diff adds hooks and wraps the app in an InternetIdentityProvider.",

    {
      "description": "Adds a footer with copyright and an external link/attribution (caffeine.ai).",
      "reason": "Footer content/attribution is not mentioned in the requirements and is extra visible page content beyond reproducing the provided greeting page elements.",

    {
      "description": "Adds click-to-trigger emoji burst behavior on the whole page.",
      "reason": "REQ-2 asks for overlay/non-blocking/cleanup behavior, but does not request a click interaction to trigger bursts.",

        "frontend/src/pages/PromiseDayPage.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Adds an (empty) backend Motoko canister actor.",
      "reason": "Backend changes were to be made only if strictly necessary; an empty actor does not appear necessary for the requested static/shareable greeting page.",
